Project Overview:
Road traffic accidents are a significant public safety concern globally. Understanding the factors that influence accident severity is crucial for developing effective preventive measures and improving road safety. This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's attributes and identify patterns related to accident severity.

Dataset Description:
You can get the data from this link :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles

The dataset used for this analysis consists of two primary tables:

Accidents Table: Contains information about individual accidents, including attributes such as accident severity, location, time, and weather conditions.

Vehicles Table: Contains details about the vehicles involved in these accidents, including attributes like age of the vehicle, engine capacity, and driver-related information.


Data Preprocessing :
Before conducting the analysis, several data preprocessing steps were applied to the dataset:

-Handling missing data, including removing columns with excessive missing values and dropping records with missing values.
-Converting the date column to a datetime data type for time-related analysis.
-Creating additional features like "Hour" and "Daytime" to categorize accidents by time of day.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
The exploratory data analysis includes the following:

Descriptive statistics for numerical attributes like the number of casualties and vehicles.
Frequency counts for categorical attributes such as accident severity, road type, and weather conditions.
Correlation analysis to identify relationships between numeric attributes.
Time-based analysis to understand accident patterns throughout the day.


Getting Started:
To replicate this analysis locally, follow these steps:

Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/road-accident-severity-analysis.git


Navigate to the project directory:

shell
cd road-accident-severity-analysis


Install the required Python packages. It is recommended to create a virtual environment first:

shell
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script that corresponds to the analysis you want to reproduce.
